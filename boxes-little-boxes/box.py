# Problem Statement
# You have 100 prisoners in a squid game.
# The numbers 1-100 are uniquely assigned to each prisoner.
# Each prisoner will, one at a time, enter a room filled with 100 boxes.
# The boxes are similarly numbered 1-100, but the numbering is not
# visible on the outside of the box.
# A prisoner can open a box, see the number inside the box, and enter the
# box if and only if their number matches the boxes number.
# Each prisoner can open up to 50 boxes.
# If any prisoner canâ€™t find their box within 50 tries the game ends in a loss.
# Otherwise, the game ends in a win if all prisoners have entered the correct box.

# Additional notes:

# - Prisoners can strategize freely before the game begins.
# - Prisoners can arrange the boxes before the game begins.
# - Prisoners can choose their numbers.
# - Prisoners can choose in what order they enter the box room.
# - Once a prisoner enters a box they are visible by all who open the same box.
# - The optimal strategy allows for all prisoners to survive ~30% of the time.
