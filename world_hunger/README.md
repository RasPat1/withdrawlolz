 Gmae Description
 Objective: Solve world hunger by distributing resources

Base Ideas
Model the world as a deries of countries
Each country has a population
Each country has a food production capacity
Each person requires the same amount of food
Each country has a foor production capacity
You can move food from place to place to help feed world



Addtional Ideas
Food production capacity is fixed but fluctuates according to weather
You have some amount of money that you use to buy, sell, distribute food
Basically you're a nonprofit rather than god so your goal is to end world hunger
You can do things like pay a certain amount to run a "marketing campaign"
It costs you money to buy food, and distribute food
SO it woudl make sense for you to buy food form the cheast place.. 
but what if where you need to distibute it to is very far and therefore has a high cost 
of distribution
Price of distribution wihtin a country may have a cost as well (think unstable govermnets etc)
food production is based on area, population, climate,
population changes each turn based on fertility rate adn how hungry people are
population dies depending on hunger rate so doign bad makes poeple die and everyone beign dead means losing the game
