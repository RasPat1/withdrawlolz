# A 2D peak finder
# Given a 2D list of integers return the location
# of a peak if one exists
# A 2D peak is a location i,j such that the
# value at i,j is greater than or equal to each
# of the values (i+1,j), (i-1,j), (i,j-1), (i,j+1)
# if they exist
# There are a number of different algorithms
# What can we try?
